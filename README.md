# imaginary-friends
Imaginary friends is an Esports team / player API and website.


#How? Why?
Creating an Esports team should not be a case of money. Let's give control back to the players by making an API / Site where teams can be kept track of, players can create their 'Proffesional' profile - and even apply to teams.

A great way to find teams/teammates - Imaginary Friends takes it's name from the Deadmau5 song and is hoping to inspire the next generation of gamers to play together, from a young age.
